Overview
Fall into the sugaring underworld with Brook, who worked behind the scenes at notorious sugar daddy website SeekingArrangement while trying her own luck as a sugar baby. Part coming of age memoir and part exposÃ© with a twist of grim dating advice, Brookâ€™s story parallels her unusual relationship history with her ascension working for a pseudo-dating website designed to protect predatory men. Through media manipulation and dangerous lies, the company acts as an agency for sex trafficking and exploitation on an enormous scale. Her story points a spotlight on this dark corner of the internet and its insidious prominence in modern society. Between pressures from a controversial CEO and the confusion of navigating her own misguided sex work, she learns the truth about an evil machine that hides pedophiles in plain sight. Many underage sex trafficking reports from law enforcement and womenâ€™s centers cite a sugar daddy website as the root cause of abuse. A law was passed in 2018 called FOSTA-SESTA that holds websites criminally responsible for their part in facilitating the internet sex trade. So why arenâ€™t these websites being investigated? Brook is wondering the same thing.
