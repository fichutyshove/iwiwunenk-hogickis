From #1 New York Times bestselling author Sharon M. Draper comes a debut picture book about a timid little ballerina who learns that the show must go onâ€”and willâ€”with a little help from her friends.
 
 Bella loves ballet class and listens hard to the music so she can tippy-toe turn, point, and pliÃ© in perfect time. When Madame announces a recital, Bella is determined to do her best. But when she tries to stretch up to leap lightly like a cloud, she wobbles and almost topplesâ€”luckily, a friend catches her.
 
 Now, Bellaâ€™s nervous; maybe she canâ€™t do this like she thought she could. On recital day, when the curtain goes up and the dancers get in position, Bella freezes. Can she find her courage in time to take the stage?
