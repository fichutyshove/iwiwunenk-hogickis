Featuring exquisite photographs of every structure the architect designed from scratch or incorporated into a historical building, this elegant volume is as sumptuous and inviting as a Scarpa interior.
 
 Although he was not widely known during his lifetime, Carlo Scarpa has in the past-half century become one of the most revered of modern architects. His passion for integrating the ancient with the modern, the natural with the built environment, and the sensual qualities of glass, wood and stone, makes him the perfect architect for this moment, when the preservation of historic buildings and sensitivity to environmental impact is of supreme importance.
 As authoritative as it is attractive, this book features balanced introduction to Scarpa‚Äôs work, weighing the opinions of both champions and critics of his work. More than 200 photographs and their accompanying illuminating texts capture the astounding beauty of Scarpa‚Äôs designs, allowing readers to experience the interplay of light, texture and line in a way that is second only to viewing the works in person.
 Arguably the most definitive volume available on this consummate craftsman and artist, this book explores Scarpa‚Äôs lasting legacy of meticulous craftsmanship, respect for tradition, and a deep understanding of the relationship between architecture, nature, and human experience.
