A collection of over 200 breathtaking photos celebrating the history and cultural impact of the Asian American social justice movement, from a beloved photographer who sought to change the world, one photograph at a time
 
 ‚ÄúFor generations, Corky taught us how to see ourselves‚Äîas individuals and as a community.‚Äù‚ÄîHua Hsu, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Stay True
 
 Known throughout his lifetime as the ‚Äúundisputed, unofficial Asian American photographer laureate,‚Äù the late photojournalist Corky Lee documented Asian American and Pacific Islander communities for fifty years, breaking the stereotype of Asian Americans as docile, passive, and, above all, foreign to this country. Corky Lee‚Äôs Asian America is a stunning retrospective of his life‚Äôs work‚Äîa selection of the best photographs from his vast collection, from his start in New York‚Äôs Chinatown in the 1970s to his coverage of diverse Asian American communities across the country until his untimely passing in 2021.
 
 Corky Lee&amp;#039;s Asian America traces Lee‚Äôs decades-long quest for photographic justice, following Asian American social movements for recognition and rights alongside his artistic development as an activist social photographer. Iconic photographs feature protests against police brutality in New York in the 1970s, a Sikh man draped in an American flag after 9/11, and a reenactment of the completion of the transcontinental railroad of 1869 featuring descendants of Chinese railroad workers, and his last photos of community life and struggle during the coronavirus pandemic. Asian American writers, artists, activists, and friends of Lee reflect on his life and career and provide rich historical and cultural context to his photographs, including a foreword from writer Hua Hsu and contributions from artist Ai Weiwei, filmmaker Ren√©e Tajima-Pe√±a, writer Helen Zia, photographer Alan Chin, historian Gordon Chang, playwright David Henry Hwang, and more.
 
 Featuring never-before-seen photographs alongside his best-known images, Corky Lee‚Äôs Asian America represents Lee‚Äôs mission to chronicle a history of inclusion, resistance, ethnic pride, and patriotism. This is a remarkable documentation of vital moments in Asian American history and a timely reminder that it‚Äôs also a history that we continue to make.
