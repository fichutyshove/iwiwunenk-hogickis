Overview
Are you losing your &quot;war of art&quot;? Are you being defeated by a tendency to procrastination, self-doubt, fear, distraction, and perfectionism? Are you self-sabotaging your loftiest artistic entrepreneurial dreams? The antidote is in nine words: PUT YOUR ASS WHERE YOUR HEART WANTS TO BE. Can you shift your artistic identity-your &quot;ass&quot;-from the shallow, fearful, superficial Ego to the wise, loving fearless Self? Can you commit to your dream for the long haul and for keeps? In this book, bestselling author Steven Pressfield delivers the tough-love inspiration to help you make this life-altering transformation.
